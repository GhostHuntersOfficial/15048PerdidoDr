                    <h2>The Haunting of the Perdido House - Investigated by Tyler Jacobs - Date: October 15th, 2015</h2>
                  <p> Hello, my name is <b>Tyler Jacobs</b>. I’m not a professional, but I’ve been obsessed with ghosts and the supernatural since I was a kid. I always wanted to prove that ghosts are real. That’s why, in August 2016, I decided to visit a house in my local aera. I found an article in the newspaper talking about hearing strange voices in the house at night. Seeing this as an opportunity to prove ghosts were real I decided to investigate. When I called the phone number at the bottom of the page the man who picked up was the owner. He told me his family was currently living in a hotel because they did not feel comfortable living there anymore. I asked if I could investigate to see what was really going on and he obliged, but warned me to be careful.</p>
                  <p> The pervious owner told me his family had been living there for a little less than a year when "Stuff got weird"
                  <p> The family had reported the following...</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The Sound of chains</li>
                    <li>Scratching on doors</li>
                    <li>Temporary Posessions</li>
                    <li>Flickering Lights</li>
                    <li>A figure standing in the <b>Dark</b></li>
                    <li>Unlocking of doors</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h2>My Time In The House</h2>
                  <p>I arrived at the Perdido residence late in the evening. The house had 2 floors with the bedrooms upstairs and the kitchen, living room and pantry downstairs. I went inside alone, just me and my flashlight. The air inside felt… heavy. Like something was watching me. It was colder than outside, even though it wasn’t supposed to be.</p> 
                  <p>I started with a basic walkthrough, I set up a few motion sensors and turned on my EMF reader. I was trying to capture any unusual sounds or movement, but nothing happened at first. Then, something strange happened. I heard footsteps. But it wasnt mine... it was someone else's. They were soft, slow and rythmic. I thought it might be an animal, but it didn’t sound human. This was something heavier. Something that didn’t belong.</p>
                  <p>Against my better judgement I set my things up to stay overnight in the master bedroom.</p>
                  <p>Around 10 that night I was geting ready for sleep when it happened. All of a sudden my EMF reader when to 5 (The highest It can go) and a loud slamming came from downstairs. I had to investigate. the moment I steped into the pantry room I saw it laying there. <b>There was a dead body.</b> I ran away so fast I didnt even collect my things I just left.</p>
                  <p>There is a demon in the house <b>DO NOT LIVE HERE OR YOU COULD DIE</b></p>
